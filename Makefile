# makefile for decryptcat, based off same ol' "generic makefile".
# Usually do "make systype" -- if your systype isn't defined, try "generic"
# or something else that most closely matches, see where it goes wrong, fix
# it, and MAIL THE DIFFS back to Hobbit.

### PREDEFINES

# DEFAULTS, possibly overridden by <systype> recursive call:
# pick gcc if you'd rather , and/or do -g instead of -O if debugging
# debugging
# DFLAGS = -DTEST -DDEBUG
DFLAGS = -DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE
CFLAGS = -O
XFLAGS = 	# xtra cflags, set by systype targets
XLIBS =		# xtra libs if necessary?
# -Bstatic for sunos,  -static for gcc, etc.  You want this, trust me.
STATIC =
CC = cc $(CFLAGS)
LD = $(CC) -s	# linker; defaults to stripped executables
o = o		# object extension

ALL = decryptcat

### BOGON-CATCHERS
